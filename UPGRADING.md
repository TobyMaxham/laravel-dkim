# From v1 to v2

You can only use **v2** if you upgraded to Laravel **9.x**.<br>
Also at the time of writing, the v2 does not support the **Signer Identity**.<br>
If you are using the v1 with the Signer Identity, you need to wait for some updates. Please feel free to make a pull request to enable the Signer Identity.
